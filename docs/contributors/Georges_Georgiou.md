## why do I exist in TF 

- to Answer my "Why"
 - whether it is TF or any project I personaly spend time on, my contribution to the world through this project needs to answer the question "are you leaving this world in a better place than you found it?". 

Which is to get the internet to every corner of the earth at a price point that makes a real difference.


## My Priorities 
- To make sure the TF operations are functioning effectively within our values. 
- To provide the correct Tools to TF Team members so they also as able to effectively do their tasks.
